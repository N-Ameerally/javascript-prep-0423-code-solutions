## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  function keyword, function name, parameters, function body, Return statement
- How do you call a function?
  the function name followed by parentheses ()
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  A parameter is a variable declared in the function's definition, and it represents a value that the function expects to receive when it is called.
  An argument, on the other hand, is a value passed into a function when it is called. The argument can be a literal value, a variable, an expression, or even another function call. When a function is called, the argument is passed in place of the corresponding parameter in the function's definition.
