## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?
  In JavaScript, the strict equality operator (===) compares two values for equality without performing type coercion.
- What is the logical **and** operator?
  The logical AND operator (&&) is a binary operator in JavaScript that returns true if both of its operands are true, and false otherwise.
- Can you name some comparison operators?
  Equal to (==): returns true if the operands are equal, after performing type coercion if necessary.
  Strictly equal to (===): returns true if the operands are equal without performing type coercion.
  Not equal to (!=): returns true if the operands are not equal, after performing type coercion if necessary.
  Strictly not equal to (!==): returns true if the operands are not equal without performing type coercion.
  Greater than (>): returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
  Greater than or equal to (>=): returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
  Less than (<): returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
